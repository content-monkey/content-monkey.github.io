<p>Hiring a great copywriter is the single most important thing you can do for your business (online and off).</p>

<p>When you hire a professional copywriter, you’re not just getting someone who can write amazing, persuasive copy that can lead to sales, you’re hiring someone who can capture your services and convey them to the right audience without sounding like they’re doing that.</p>

<p>Copywriters are trained to learn as much as they can about the industries and products they write for to make sure they write quality content that delivers results.</p>

<p>Who has the time to develop and write great copy when you’re running your own business? And that’s just the thing – no one has time to focus on their site, yet, for most businesses, it’s the first point of contact your customer sees. So why wouldn’t you make it a priority?</p>

</p><strong>Mobile first</strong></p>

<p>We write for mobile first because we know that over 80% of shoppers for products and services use their mobiles in the first instance.</p>

<p>We write words that sell. We do our research so we understand the lay of the land – who your competitors are, what keywords customers are using, and when are they most likely to buy.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a campaign, a service, a product or an idea we know how to write words that reach your audience and sell your message. Our specialists write across all sectors and industries.</p>
