<tr style="border: 1px solid #cccccc";>
<td style="padding: 12px";><strong>10.45 am: </strong><strong>What makes you unique?</strong></td>
<td style="padding: 12px";>Think about what makes your company different to other companies operating in the same space. On the post-it notes provided write down as many ideas as you can think of.</span>
<p>Group into categories (targeted to your sector) eg:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>Client types</li>
 	<li>Fund size</li>
 	<li>Legislative restraints</li>
 	<li>Success stories</li>
</ol>
<p>Break these broad categories down into more detail:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;">a) What ideas are similar, can be grouped?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;">b) Revisit all ideas – place dots on the ones you think are most important. (This helps with messaging hierarchy)</p>

<tr style="border: 1px solid #cccccc";>
<td style="padding: 12px";><strong>11.15 am – 12 pm: </strong><strong>Customer personas</strong></td>
<td style="padding: 12px";>
<p><Creating personas helps prepare targeted messaging that works on an emotional level for an intended audience, as well as helping form a very clear idea about the problems your clients are facing so you can solve their business problems in the form of your products and/or services.</span></p>
<p>Think about and take notes on: Who are your ideal clients? What do they like to do? What restricts them? Where are their pain points?</p>
<p>Reflect on what makes you different from others offering similar products or services; what type of clients most value your type of product or service? Who can afford to pay? Where do they like to spend their spare time? How do they spend their leisure time?</span></p>

<ol>
 	<li>Identify 3-4 persona groups.</li>
 	<li>Spend some time discussing and sharing notes with the group to enrich each profile.</li>
 	<li>Discuss what might limit or restrict each profile.</li>
 	<li>Give each persona a name, eg Tech-savvy Sally, or Noel the Newbie Investor</li>
</ol>

<tr style="border: 1px solid #cccccc";>
<td style="padding: 12px";><strong>12 pm – 12.15 pm</strong></td>
<td style="padding: 12px";>
<p>Take all the data compiled during the previous session and identify content zones, eg CONTENT FOR NEW INVESTORS, or CONTENT FOR FEMALE LEADERS/CEOs and begin to workshop some key topic areas for each zone.</p>
<p>Now we can begin to craft messages for each profile, for each zone. Pay attention to the rules we learned earlier on what to consider when crafting key messages.</p>
