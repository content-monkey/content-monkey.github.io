<p>Given the almost daily announcements recently from the world of social media, we thought we’d follow up on our <a href="https://contentmonkey.com.au/posts/twitter-on-the-ropes-with-the-launch-of-threads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last post</a> which looked at Meta’s tilt at Twitter, now ‘X’.
</p><p>
After its massive initial surge in sign-ups, usage of Meta’s rival app Threads has <a href="https://time.com/6305383/meta-threads-failing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plummeted 80 per cent.</a>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Threads made signing up easy for those with an Instagram account but not so for many X users who found the app comparatively featureless.
</p><p>
With the heat on to stay in the game, Threads has been tweaking as fast as it can, announcing a <a href="https://gizmodo.com.au/2023/08/threads-gets-a-couple-more-twitter-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repost feature</a> and in recent days launching a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/metas-threads-website-is-now-live-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web-based version</a>.
</p><p>
Oddly, just as Threads piles on new features, X has been removing them.
</p><p>
Having already torpedoed a chunk of his social media platform’s functionality, Elon Musk recently floated the idea of deleting X’s block feature.
</p><p>
Some users, including anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinsky, immediately suggested the tetchy tech bro <a href="https://twitter.com/MonicaLewinsky/status/1692697894929785246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rethink the idea</a>. Forbes contributor John Koetsier called the idea <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2023/08/18/uproar-on-x-elon-musk-says-blocking-users-will-be-deleted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shocking</a>: “The result is likely to be even more division, anger, and harassment on the platform.”
</p><p>
Musk argues X’s mute function will be adequate (albeit after some beefing up) while at the same time conceding the platform could, as predicted, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-admits-x-twitter-may-fail-predictions-2023-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be doomed</a>.
</p><p>
Ad placement and lack of content moderation continue to plague X, with brands again <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/16/tech/x-ads-pro-nazi-account-brand-safety/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulling advertising</a> from the platform.
</p><p>
However, as brands start to build a presence on Threads, ad space on the app remains unavailable. Marketers may also be looking at Threads’ parent company Meta, owner of Facebook, which has been <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/meta-rules-online-racism-against-indigenous-people-meets-community-standards-20230815-p5dwqt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticised</a> for its laissez-faire approach to content moderation. (There are also some continued privacy concerns restricting access in the EU.)
</p><p>
Contrast that with rival BlueSky who has begun pursuing revenue directions <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other than advertising</a>, such as <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom domains</a>. The platform remains in beta, with sign-ups restricted to a waitlist for those without an invite code. Though if it launches fully-formed, it may succeed where Threads, by going too early, has (so far) failed.
</p><p>
X’s other notable rival, Mastodon, continues to take on disenchanted users, who may be forgiven for thinking they’ve fled an autocracy only to land in a fiefdom as users battle with moderators over issues such as <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@mairin/110932260818350698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of multi-lingual support</a>, or just feel generally <a href="https://erinkissane.com/mastodon-is-easy-and-fun-except-when-it-isnt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwelcome</a>.
</p><p>
Interestingly, Threads has committed to using ‘ActivityPub’, the protocol underlying Mastodon and other ‘federated’ platforms.
</p><p>
“Soon, you'll be able to follow and interact with people on other fediverse platforms, like Mastodon”, Threads states.
</p><p>
BlueSky, on the other hand, is building its own ‘AT Protocol’ which it claims will be a bigger, better federated protocol.
</p><p>
Confused yet?
</p><p>
In short, as Threads bulks up on features, it may grab enough user share to head off BlueSky before its expected launch in the coming months.
</p><p>
For marketers, regardless of how BlueSky’s ambitious, ad-free business model plays out, some assurances around content moderation would likely be a deciding factor in who comes out on top in a post-X social media world.
